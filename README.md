# Smart Light System
This project implements a smart RGB LED lighting system using a Raspberry Pi.
The system integrates computer vision, gesture recognition, and custom control logic to provide an interactive lighting experience.

# Key features:

Face and hand recognition for personalized lighting modes.
Gesture-based control: change colors, brightness, and patterns with simple hand movements.
Programmable LED effects using NeoPixel strips.
Event-driven notifications: lights can flash or change color based on triggers or alarms.
Modular software design: easy to extend with new sensors or features.

# Technologies used:

Python 3
OpenCV & MediaPipe (CV & gesture recognition)
NeoPixel / RGB LED control
Raspberry Pi hardware platform
